# renew-lib

[Renew][1] is a multi-formalism editor and simulator that provides a flexible 
modeling approach. With renew-js we want to improve the user interaction with 
the editor. To archive a multi-formalism editor and simulator we base the 
formalisms on metamodels and provide a plugin-architecture to extend the 
domain specific languages.
